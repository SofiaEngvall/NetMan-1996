     Playing the game

When the game starts the ghosts are in their home. They are
strong and starts to hunt the pacman (you).

You are supposed to eat all the dot's on the level to go on to
the next one, collecting different amounts of points for
everything.
To your assistance you have got the big dots. When you have
eaten a big dot the ghosts become weak and you will be able to
eat them (instead of the other way around).

When you have eaten a ghost it will return to it's home and be
strong again. This means that you only can eat each ghost once
for every big dot.

The "power" of the dot will not last for ever eather. If you
eat a second big dot while you still have got some of the power
of the old one. It will be replaced by the new (not add to it).


     Points

You get points for the most things you do:
- Each ordinary dot gives you 10 points.
- A big dot gives you 50 points.
- When you eat a ghost the number of points you get depends 
  on how many ghosts you have taken sence you ate a big dot. 
  The first ghost gives you 100 points, the second 200, the 
  third 400 and the fourth and last possible 800.
- When you have finished a level you get 2000 points.
- When you have went true all available levels you get a
  bonus of 10000 points before you continue...

In the upper right corner of the screen you can see how many
lifes you have, how many points you have and how many dots you
have left to eat on the level.
